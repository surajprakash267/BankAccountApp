This BankAccount App is a basic app, which has no any UI added in it. It was created to practice the basic concepts like:
* Private Keyword: We have used this keyword to declare a variable transactionHistory , to ensure that this variable cannot be accessed outside the Class.
* Classes and it's object : We have created the BankAccount Class and then created it's object in the main.kt file to use the class properties.

  You can do the below things using this app:
  * deposit amount in the bank
  * Withdraw amount from the bank
  * Track the transaction history
